**Logistics optimization**  
Logistics touches every part of an enterprise and even goes beyond to include suppliers, carriers and customers.  Needless to say, logistics is complicated with many interdependent components.  This high degree of complexity is difficult to manage without the use of models that accurately represent the processes and their interactions.
Reduce costs, and deadheads.  

In this Article, we will apply Hungarian Algorithm, which is an optimization algorithm.

# Modelling the problem

## Brainstorming session
First, I should to draft some ideas on paper,
