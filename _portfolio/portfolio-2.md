Reduce costs, and deadheads.
In this Article, we will apply Hungarian Algorithm, which is an optimization algorithm.

# Modelling the problem

## Cost matrix

# Solution

If you are not familiar with trasnportation problems, you can check this good website, [Here](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~mcasquilho/compute/_linpro/index.php)
