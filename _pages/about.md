`himloul` is my personal blog to keep track on my projects. Welcome!
  
## Bio

I am a data Analyst, with a "hybrid" background in operations research. experienced in data management and data visualization using R and Python.
I helped businesses to master their operations using data management and data science techniques.
I completed my M.Sc in Industrial engineering at **[Ecole Mohammadia d'ing√©nieurs](https://www.emi.ac.ma/)** with a minor in Operations research.
Interested in Data-driven problem solving techniques, Product design, and machine learning.

I develop statistical methods and software to extract useful insights from complex large-scale data sets, arising from various real-world applications.  
am looking for job opportunities where I can help companies 
**optimize operations and product development** 
by delivering actionable data insights using R, Python, SQL and Tableau (or similar technologies).
